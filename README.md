Use a local alpr for agentdvr plate recognition


Agentdvr does not support a local alpr for recognition.  Platerecognizer is great and a lot more accurate than alpr BUT it is slow as it is an internet resource and it has a cost if doing a lot of queries.

The install of a local version of alpr is not covered here.  There are plenty of resouces for this elsewhere.

All info is in lpr.php as comments for setup

Hopefully this helps someone else and the search engines find this information for you.
